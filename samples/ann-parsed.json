I'm passionate about using state-of-the-art technology to build products that truly delight our customers and staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends.\n\nAs the Head of Engineering for the QuickBooks Platform and Mobile Organization at Intuit, I have the privilege of leading a talented team of engineers. We create financial software that helps millions of small businesses and self-employed customers to run their business. In my role, I am responsible for driving the strategy and overseeing the development of the QuickBooks mobile applications and the platform infrastructure that hosts the QuickBooks Online application.  I work closely with Product, Design and Marketing leaders to deliver best-in-class solutions across QuickBooks ecosystem.  \n\nPersonally, I enjoy solving difficult problems, learning something new every day, and using that knowledge to build something valuable. Back when I was an individual contributor for 15 years, I used to enjoy solving difficult problems, discovering the cause of a challenging bug, finding a solution to a difficult problem, or creating a scalable architecture and implementing it alongside my team.\n\nMy passion for engineering runs deep and I always approach challenges with an engineer's mindset. That's why, as an engineering leader, I aim to foster the kind of environment that I would have wanted as an engineer. I prioritize empathy, empowerment, and accountability in my leadership style. Technical expertise and strong communication skills are essential for leaders, and I hold my team to the same standard. I prioritize developing these skills in myself and my team to build a high performing organization.\n\nAs a leader, I prioritize both building the right product and building it right. I firmly believe in empowering the teams closest to the work to make decisions and take ownership of their outcomes. These principles are central to my approach to delivering top-notch solutions and cultivating high-performing teams that are passionate about technology and have the autonomy to achieve success for our customers.\n\nI strongly believe in the saying, \"Be the Change You Want to See.\" Every day, I challenge myself to make progress and strive for excellence. I find that stepping out of my comfort zone and learning new things is the best way to grow both personally and professionally. While it can be a challenging journey, I am committed to do it and to help others along the way."
